# McCulloch and Pitts Neuron Simulation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the McCulloch and Pitts model of an artificial neuron. The simulation software allows users to create a neuron with customizable inputs, weights, biases, and activation functions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the simulation on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcculloch-pitts-neuron-simulation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mcculloch-pitts-neuron-simulation

3. Run the simulation script:

   ```bash
   python main.py

4. Follow the prompts to input the number of inputs, weights, biases, and their respective values.

5. The program will calculate the output based on the McCulloch and Pitts model.
